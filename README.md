# 🐳 Podverse Mockup - Docker Setup & Usage

## 🚀 Prerequisites

* [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) installed on your machine (Windows, macOS, WSL2, or a real-deal Linux box).
* Docker Compose is included with Docker Desktop.

> 🐧 Linux users: May the flags be ever in your favor. Install Docker & Compose manually and enable the daemon.

---

## 📦 Cloning the Repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Cramessar/podverse_mockup.git
cd podverse_mockup
```

---

## 🔨 Build Docker Images

You should have `Dockerfile`s for backend, frontend, and the database setup in place.

To build and start all services (backend, frontend, and Postgres):

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

Once built, containers should appear in Docker Desktop, humming along nicely.

---

## ▶️ Running the Containers

You’ve got options:

* **Option 1**: Click the “play” button in Docker Desktop. Easy.
* **Option 2**: Real devs use terminals. (Or masochists. Hard to tell.)

```bash
docker compose up
```

This will start all services as defined in `docker-compose.yml`.

---

## 🧠 Database Setup & Initialization

Schema and seeding are handled automatically by the backend container using scripts like `init_database.sql` or individual seed scripts.

For details on how it works or to re-run seeders, see:

```
/podverse_db/README.md
```

---

## 🌐 Access the Application

* **Frontend**: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
* **Backend API**: [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)
* **Postgres (DB)**: `localhost:5432` (connect via pgAdmin or DBeaver)

> Postgres creds are usually defined in `.env` or `docker-compose.yml`. Use those if you need to connect manually.

## 🏠 Ollama Container Requirements

To run the AI container using Ollama:

You will need ollama. Make sure to download the program [Ollama Download](https://ollama.com/download).
Then you will need models. Some models are better than others for different things. [Models](https://ollama.com/search)

If you want some suggesttions for now `mistral`, `gemma3`, `gemma3n`


* The default expected endpoint is:

```
OLLAMA_BASE_URL=http://ollama:11434
```
But seeing as we need 11434 to make sure ollama is running the container uses 11435. This is important

* Make sure Ollama the app is running otherwise the Ollama container will not see what models you have downloaded.


* Running and reachable by the app backend.
* Loaded with at least one supported model.

To check models:

```bash
http://localhost:5050/ollama/models
```

To pull a model manually, click on the model name. In the top right there should be a command like this:

```bash
ollama run gemma3n
```

Copy and paste it in command prompt. You dont have to navigate to any folder. Just open as usual and past the command.

### 📂 Environment Variables (`.env`)

This project uses environment variables to keep configuration clean and secure across services. Create a `.env` file at the root of the project using the `.env.example` as a guide.

Here are a few key variables you’ll need:

```env
# 🐘 Main Database
POSTGRES_USER=your_postgres_user
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=your_postgres_password
POSTGRES_DB=your_postgres_db
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://${POSTGRES_USER}:${POSTGRES_PASSWORD}@database:5432/${POSTGRES_DB}

# 🤖 AI Database
AI_DB_USER=your_ai_user
AI_DB_PASSWORD=your_ai_password
AI_DB_NAME=your_ai_db_name
AI_DATABASE_URL=postgresql://${AI_DB_USER}:${AI_DB_PASSWORD}@ai_db:5432/${AI_DB_NAME}

# 🧠 AI Service
BACKEND_URL=http://backend:8000
PYTHONPATH=/app
PODVERSE_BACKEND_PATH=/app/backend/app

# 🎧 API Keys
LISTENNOTES_API_KEY=your_listennotes_api_key_here

# 🦙 Ollama (Local Model Path)
OLLAMA_MODEL_PATH=C:/Users/your_user/.ollama  # Or wherever Ollama stores your models
```

> ⚠️ **Important:**  
> This `.env` file is used by **multiple services** in the Docker Compose setup — such as the backend, AI container, and both databases. Docker Compose will automatically inject these values via `env_file`.

🔍 You don’t need to memorize these — just peek at `.env.example` and fill in the blanks. It’ll make sense, eventually. Promise. ✨

---

![Look for this icon](ollama_icon.png) 

in the bottom right of your screen. Should make sense.🦙

If you right click this and click on settings you will see you `Model location` and `Expose Ollama to the network`

I trust this makes sense given the above info.

## 🛑 Stopping Containers

To gracefully stop all running services:

```bash
docker compose down
```

---

## 🧹 Cleanup & Troubleshooting

If Docker starts acting like a gremlin got into your volumes, try the following to clean things up:

### 📼 Remove stopped containers, dangling images, and unused networks:

```bash
docker system prune -a
```

> ⚠️ Warning: This deletes *all* unused data. Use wisely.

### 🗑️ Remove all unused volumes (especially useful for DB issues):

```bash
docker volume prune
```

### 🔥 Nuke and rebuild everything (if all else fails):

I cannot stress this enough. Too many problems will be caused by old build caches, volumes, etc. Just run these commands every few days and rebuild. 

```bash
docker compose down -v --remove-orphans
docker system prune -a
docker volume rm $(docker volume ls -q)
docker compose up --build
```

---

## 🛠️ Helpful Commands

Just use docker desktop. It simplifies all of these tips.

### View logs for a container:

```bash
docker logs <container-name>
```

### List all containers (running or not):

```bash
docker ps -a
```

### Restart a single container:

```bash
docker restart <container-name>
```

### Check container health status (if healthchecks are defined):

```bash
docker inspect --format='{{json .State.Health}}' <container-name>
```

## 📝 Notes

* Make sure your line endings for `entrypoint.sh` or seed scripts use **LF**, not **CRLF**, especially if editing on Windows.
* Port conflicts? Double-check nothing else is running on 3000/8000/5432.
